Automated Parking System using ML - Compsoft Technologies

Python script that performs license plate recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. This script takes an image of a car with a visible license plate, processes the image, extracts the license plate, and then uses Tesseract OCR to recognize the text on the license plate. The recognized text is then printed and stored in a CSV file along with the date and time of the recognition.

 Goal: Understand the working of Image detection and Improve the accuracy 
 <br>
 Achieved: Understood about image processing and this improved code includes adaptive thresholding to handle variations in lighting conditions, and contour filtering based on area to eliminate small, irrelevant contours.
